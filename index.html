		<p>Acknowledgements:
Include 2-3 paragraphs to acknowledge those who helped you during your placement experience.
<p>I worked with another ux placement designer who was finishing their placement year, he helped me get upskill in new front-end skills, for example using “sass” and “bem-model” to compile CSS. I found this really helpful as I was able to ask for advice form experienced designers in writing front-end code. I found this very helpful as I was learning a lot of things at once, and with the help of learning from other designers helped me gain a better understanding of the tasks I needed to complete.</p>

<p>I worked with a senior UX designer which gave me great insight into understanding the design process, creating user journeys etc. I found working with a senior ux designer gave me a lot of knowledge around creating user journeys and being involved in creating these. I worked with business analysts to help get a better idea of what needs to be created for that journey. This proved a great help as this allowed me to ask questions to see exactly what and why we needed particular elements.</p>

<p>Working alongside developers also was great in helping me understanding “git” command line and creating pull requests etc through the terminal. They provided me a range of new skills that they use and how I can implement this using the terminal and creating new design patterns.</p>

Placement company:
<p>Outline of company, origins, size, client base (if allowed), type of work offered to clients (if allowed)
Kainos creates digital technology services for companies world-wide, they have been running for over 30 years now and have around 1,000 employees across Europe and the USA. There are 5 different divisions within Kainos Digital services, Evolve, Work day, Work smart and applied Innovation. Their main services are mostly within transforming government, health care and the private sector.</p>


My role during placement
<p>During my time at Kainos I took on the role of a front-end developer, this is where I updated and created a style-guide that consisted of all the design elements from a pattern library. I provided a code snippets for each design pattern to enable developers to easily implement the code. I was also in charge of ensuring all design components were cross browser compatible and designed for particular devices. This sometimes was tricky due to the application being mostly used in “Internet explorer, sometimes this was a challenge to complete, but I learnt a lot by doing so. I also took on the role of UX designer by creating user journeys and solving problems within these. This enabled me to get a great experience and gain more confidence in both front-end development and ux design.</p>


My role
5-7 paragraphs outlining your role during placement
Placement Competencies
<p>I was able to take over the role of a previous placement student and learn all the new skills in order to maintain and update the style guide. I was able to achieve this and successfully update and create new design patterns using sass and the bem-model throughout the rest of the project.</p> 

Learning and Skills
<p>I have learnt many new skills within Kainos, both front end and design. When working with front-end code to build a pattern library I learnt how to use “sass” and the “bem-model” and through using these new skills I found more effective ways to write my code. For example, when using sass it’s much easier and cleaner to create responsive designs. I found these new skills will benefit me a lot and I will continue to write in sass instead of css as this prevents duplication of css and enables me to write reusable code. I learnt how to use the terminal and push my updates to the style guide throughout this to Visual Studios using git commands. I now have skills to create pull requests through the terminal, create new branches, commit my updates to Visual studios to allow developers to review my code. If there were any issues me and the developer would quickly able to resolve this by looking at how the code was previous before the update.</p>

Response to Feedback
<p>I received some feedback and advice on using the git command line, as this was new to me I found this confusing to begin with. I noticed I wasn’t pulling down the new version of code each time but I couldn’t understand why, for example not branching off the master. I knew this could cause conflicts within the code when someone else was making a change. I then asked a developer for some advice and feedback on the current way I was pushing my code and showed my process of creating branches etc. I was able to explain this clearly and outline what my issue was, which was simply going back to the master each time. I found this really helpful as now each time I remember to always go back to master, this saves any conflicts arising in the code down the line. As I asked for feedback when I had the problem, the issue was solved much quicker and I was able to carry out the correct process.</p>

Challenges, Achievements and Disappointments
<p>I found it challenging at the beginning of my placement as I was being introduced to new coding skills that I have never used before, and this can be quite over whelming to begin with. Through working with others ux designers and developers I was able to understand and use my new skills. The biggest challenge was to take over the role of the style-guide and starting learning new coding skills from the 2nd day I started as I was replacing the previous placement student. I needed to get up to speed on “sass”, bem model, git command line, terminal, etc all within a month of starting. This I felt was my biggest achievement in all of my placement, as I was able to quickly learn off a designer the basics of the style-guide then it was over to me to keep creating new front-end code and continue to these new skills through more tutorials. When the placement student left I was the only front-end developer on the team so I felt this was a great achievement in successfully creating the style-guide independently and with developers until the project had ended.<p>

Impact of the Placement
<p>The overall impact I feel placement has given me is developing my skills in front-end development and designing user journeys. I have gained more confidence in this role by attending all meetings, providing my input, sharing what I’m working on in stand ups and going to conferences in and outside of Kainos.</p>

Personal and Professional Development
<p>I wanted to get more involved in the front-end coding and expand my skills in this area when starting Kainos, so my first project was great in helping me do this. I then wanted to expand my knowledge and skills within design more, screen designs etc.</p>

Technical
<p>Gulp, sass, bem-model, node, terminal, git command line, Git hub</p>

Design
Sketch, Invision, Marvel app
<p>I picked up sketch quite quickly as I previously was using illustrator. I was learning how to use Sketch within the first week of starting my placement. Not</p>


Tools Explored and experimented with:

Figma
<p>I found Figma in an article related to some of the best design tools for example Sketch and Adobe XD. As I’m already familiar with these tools I thought Figma might be a good idea to explore as it looks quite similar to Sketch and I have seen from the feedback that some people found it more useful than using Sketch.</p>

Free-hand collaboration
<p>I have never used free hand collaboration, although I think this would be very useful in terms of working with others. It allows you to share the link with others to enable them to all view the same screen and add comments, sketch something etc. I think this would be a great way to connect everyone to view the same screen, eg people working remotely etc, it still allows them to add their input directly and lets everyone see it instantly.</p>
